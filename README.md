Hi, I'm David

I'm a QA Software Test Engineer certified by ISTQB, with hands-on experience in manual testing, bug reporting, and test case design.  

 **What you'll find here:**
 
 Two basic HTML pages that I created as part of my studies. I used Visual Studio to write the code.<br><br>
 
 
- To open the first HTML page, click the link below:                  
              [link to HTML page](https://david-kahana1.github.io/HTML/)             
  To view the source code, open the file - 'index.html'. <br><br>
 


- To open the second HTML page with the CSS and JavaScript, click the link below:        
              [link to HTML page with CSS and JavaScript](https://david-kahana1.github.io/HTML/CSS%20and%20JS/index.html)              
  To view the source code, open the file - 'index.html' inside the folder 'CSS and JS'.
